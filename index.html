                <p>I have a lot of different hobbies that I enjoy. One passion I've always had is sports. Since I was a little kid I've always loved playing and watching all kinds of sports. Nowadays I mostly just play recreational basketball, football and soccer with my friends. I'm a big Philadelphia sports fan and I watch every Eagles, Sixers and Flyers game I can. Because of my interest in sports, one of my career goals is to become an Athletic Director for a highschool or college. Another interest I have is nature. I love to go hiking and kayaking with friends, and to explore new places. I enjoy fishing a lot as well, but mostly just for the outdoors aspect of it. One of my newer interests is contributing to political and social change. Over the past few years I have become very passionate about many of the issues that people in this country and across the world are facing, and I want to do what I can to help people. This includes doing volunteer work and joining organizations that promote political and social change.</p>
                <p>This class was my introduction to web development and coding. Before this class I had always been interested in learning how coding worked, but it all seemed so difficult and overwhelming that I never tried. I'm glad to say that I actually found it to be much easier than I was expecting and I learned a lot in this class. Even if I never pursure a career that is specific to web development, I think a lot of what I learned could be useful knowledge in other areas, and I'm glad that I took this class and now have a general understanding of the basics.</p>
